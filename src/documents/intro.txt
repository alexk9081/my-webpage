    My name is Alex and this is my webpage which I built using React.js and hosted on github pages. This webpage is a place dedicated to displaying useable working examples of the projects which I create. This is currently an active project so some pages may be still a work in progess but will be updated on a semi regular basis.
    This webpage was created on February 12th, 2022 and was built from scratch as a personal project. I have prior experience using vanilla javascript so the biggest hurdle with this project was learning and understanding React.js. Overall, it's been an enjoyable project to create as it has helped me learn a lot more about javascript with things such as promises and it has also helped give me more clarity on functional programming.
